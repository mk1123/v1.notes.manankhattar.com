I don't know why it took me so long to realize this, but the reason my desk setup at home is so damn uncomfortable compared to my setup at the office is that the positioning of my keyboard and monitor makes me slightly hunched. TIL that even the slight hunch is enough to totally ruin my experience! I'm going to invest in an ergonomic (split) keyboard (hello Black Friday) so that I don't have to worry about this at all.
