I don't know why it took me so long to realize this, but my desk setup at home is so damn uncomfortable compared to my setup at the office because the positioning of my keyboard and monitor makes me slightly hunched. I'm going to invest in an ergonomic (split) keyboard (hello, Black Friday) that should hopefully save my WFH experience.
