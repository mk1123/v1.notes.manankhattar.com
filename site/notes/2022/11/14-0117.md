I spent a fair bit of the day today setting this website up! I also configured the Github [repo][repo] for my [main site][manankhattar.com] (with continuous deployment through Github Actions and a fancy custom domain), although I haven't completed setting it up yet. Of course, I'm sure there will be more clean-up to do as I keep writing. In any case, I'm excited to start using this new creative medium!
